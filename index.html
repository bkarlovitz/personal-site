                <div class="text-lg mt-5">
                    I‚Äôm an entrepreneur based in Philadelphia. I am a statistician by training, and I became a software engineer in 2012. I spent the first part of my career doing
                    <a class="underline" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-product-engineer-scott-middleton/" target="_blank">product engineering</a> in the logistics and security industries.
                </div>
                <div class="text-lg mt-5">
                    I started my first venture in 2017 with <a class="underline" href="https://chuckgeorge.com/" target="_blank">Chuck George</a>.
                    We bootstrapped <a class="underline" href="https://chuckgeorge.com/wrk/knead" target="_blank">Knead</a>, a cloud-based planning application for wholesale bakeries.
                </div>
                <div class="text-lg mt-3">
                    Following Knead, Chuck and I started Special Sauce, a publication about the business of food and beverage.
                    <a class="underline" href="https://www.georgetmaguire.com/" target="_blank">George Maguire</a> has since joined as a co-founder.
                    There is room for quality, operator-focused content in hospitality, and Special Sauce covers news and trends for people who run food and beverage businesses.

                <div class="text-lg mt-3">
                    Continuing the food theme, Chuck and I launched the Milan-based hospitality group DTM in February 2022.
                    Our first concept, <a class="underline" href="https://www.instagram.com/chucksmilano/" target="_blank">Chuck‚Äôs Burgers</a>, began operating in March 2022.

                <div class="text-lg mt-5">
                    Besides food, I have a strong interest in healthcare. Much of my current work is focused on making remote healthcare programs easier to run.
                    In February 2021, I joined <a class="underline" href="https://twitter.com/jshiz93" target="_blank">Josh Stein</a> at
                    <a class="underline" href="https://www.impilo.health/" target="_blank">Impilo</a>,
                    where we are building a device management and patient adherence platform for RPM.

                <div class="text-lg mt-5">
                    I am also a partner at the design studio <a class="underline" href="https://giuliapeyrone.com/" target="_blank">Giulia Peyrone</a>.
                    Giulia produces a variety of terrific artwork, clothing, and interior design items.

                    I invest small checks in startups, typically at the seed stage. I am not picky about industry,
                    but prefer opportunities where I can be active with network or strategy.

                    I don‚Äôt keep a strong online presence (not because I don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just really busy),
