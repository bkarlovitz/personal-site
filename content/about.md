I help software teams build sustainable DevOps culture and cloud infrastructure.

I'm a technology advisor based in Philadelphia, and I work with both local and remote
companies. I have a strong background in DevOps, security, and infrastructure as
code. I've been building cloud applications for over five years in multiple industries,
including logistics and software security.
