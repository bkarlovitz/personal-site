### Process and Infrastructure Audit

I can do a thorough audit of your DevOps process and cloud infrastructure. This
involves a multi-day engagement with your team that ends in a report detailing my
findings.

### Roadmap Development

Your cloud infrastructure needs a roadmap to stay healthy, just like your product.
I can help you list and prioritize what needs to be done.

### Retainer

Would you like to have cloud architecture expertise on-demand? You can have me on
retainer for a small monthly fee. I work with several cloud environments every year,
including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure. I have seen the good and
the ugly. Let's make you one of the goods.
